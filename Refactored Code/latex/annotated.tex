\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classData}{Data} \\*This class is used to facilitate all the transactions between the dataset in a file and the execution apparatus }{\pageref{classData}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classEdge}{Edge} \\*It defines an edge between two nodes }{\pageref{classEdge}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classGraph}{Graph} \\*This class contains all the properties relating to a group of points It has the list of points for which the hull is to be found It has the hull after running the convex hull algorithms It has the algorithms to find the convex hull }{\pageref{classGraph}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classNode}{Node} \\*This call encompasses all the properties for a node. It allows us to get the x and y coordinates or print the node for debugging purposes }{\pageref{classNode}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classUtilities}{Utilities$<$ T $>$} }{\pageref{classUtilities}}{}
