# DAA_Assignment_1
The objective of this assignment is to implement convex hull algorithms and visualize them with the help of python

## Basic Structures
It consists of two main packages
- Refactored Code: Optimized code to monitor performance
- Vizard Vision: The same code without performance gimmicks to visualize the performance of algorithms.
